   - Signature metadata captured (timestamp, IP, user agent)
   - Sequential signing workflow enforced
   - Contract status automatically updates to "FULLY_EXECUTED"

3. **✅ Complete Contract Lifecycle Management**
   - From generation → pending signatures → fully executed
   - Professional HTML contract document generation
   - Real-time signature status tracking
   - Comprehensive audit trail
